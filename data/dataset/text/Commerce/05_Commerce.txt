Before ShopBack Singapore hits its two-year mark, the local start-up revs up its presence with a mobile app launch today. From now onwards, shoppers are able to shop with greater convenience, at anytime, anywhere from computers and tablets to Apple iOS and Android apps. Expanding its move beyond desktop and mobile-optimised sites, ShopBack aims to make the “Shop-and-Save” lifestyle ubiquitous and accessible not only in Singapore, but in the rest of its markets. Currently, ShopBack is present in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and India. “Today, we help consumers save on their shopping with up to 30% Cashback offering. When we give shoppers Cashback, we’re returning them some of the money that they’ve used for their purchases via ShopBack,” said Ms. Josephine K Chow, Country Head of ShopBack Singapore. “An average shopper can save about $500 a year with just an extra click on desktop.” “With ShopBack app, shopping smart just gets simpler. Now you only need to download one app to shop and access offers at over 500 online stores like LAZADA, Groupon, ASOS and more,” said Ms. Chow.

ShopBack Singapore refreshes its store offerings with new partnerships of up to three stores per week, including the traditionally brick-and-mortar brands that are seeking effective ways to get a piece of the growing e-commerce pie. “Our retail partners pay us on a performance-driven commission model. If we don’t channel sales to them, they’re not required to pay us,” said Mr. Henry Chan, Co-Founder of ShopBack. “This attractive business proposition allows us to bring actual measurable value to our retail partners in the online space.” Apart from brands that are established in the brick-and-mortar realm, renowned online stores like Naiise and Honestbee are the latest additions to ShopBack Singapore – all signing up to provide the “Shop-and-Save” way of life to shoppers. Entirely developed in-house in Singapore, the mobile app has gone through several rigorous rounds of testing before its launch as a power-up to boost ShopBack’s status as The Smarter Way to Shop. With the app, ShopBack Singapore expects users to double their engagment with the brand and aims to achieve app downloads from at least 20% of ShopBack Singapore’s users within the first day of launch.

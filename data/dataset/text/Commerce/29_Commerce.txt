Japanese clothing company Uniqlo is using an EKG headset to analyze the brainwaves of customers to best match them to t-shirts. The algorithm splits up the data to determine five attributes: interest, like, stress, concentration and drowsiness, and match the customer to the shirt designs that have been previously analyzed for interests. This tech is more than likely a gimmick or media stunt, but it does make you wonder about the future of shopping. Will computers ever be able to truly determine our interests from analyzing our brain waves? Will this technology lead to a new era of hyper-targeted advertising? Only time will tell.

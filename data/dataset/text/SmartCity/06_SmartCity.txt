SparkCognition, a global artificial intelligence (AI) technology provider, and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (MHPS) Americas reportedly are working together to advance AI applications in MHPS-TOMONI, a new digital platform from MHPS designed to optimize power plant processes by enabling cognitive analytics and prioritizing customer collaboration. MHPS is applying SparkCognition AI-powered solutions to combined cycle power plants as part of MHPS-TOMONI and further automating predictive insights. "MHPS-TOMONI focuses on providing value to customers by offering solutions that maximize power plant operations," said Shane Mickey, VP, Strategic Planning, MHPS Americas. "MHPS partnering with world-class developers like SparkCognition to deploy AI software is further proof that MHPS-TOMONI leads the way in terms of digital solutions that boost plant performance for energy producers." MHPS-TOMONI is designed to evaluate and apply digital solutions tailored to fit each customer's priorities at the power plants they operate by emphasizing collaboration between OEM and plant operator and recognizing the need for expert human insights from both in order to boost efficiency and reliability, optimize O&M costs, and enhance environmental performance. "SparkCognition is leveraging AI to build sophisticated models automatically and deliver advanced data cleansing to identify anomalies in power plants," said Usman Shuja, GM, Industrial IoT, SparkCognition, recently named the Fastest Growing Company in Central Texas by the Austin Business Journal and ranked 20th on the 2017 CNBC Disruptor 50 list. "Utilizing SparkCognition's predictive analytics platform, SparkPredict, on MHPS's clients' digital industrial infrastructure will maximize the MHPS-TOMONI suite of services by providing groundbreaking solutions for optimizing operations and maximizing output."

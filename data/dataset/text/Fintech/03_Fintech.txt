It is ten years since the Financial Crisis and I am often asked if FinTech was born out of the crisis. In June 2007 two Bear Sterns hedge funds hit problems, by August BNP Paribas shut down access to hedge funds with sub-prime mortgage exposures, and in September Northern Rock, a UK savings and mortgage bank had a run on it, the first bank to suffer this consequence in 150 years in the UK. You think this would have set alarm bells ringing in global financial markets. Well it did, I guess they just weren't loud enough. It would be another full year before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and the global financial system melted down. Chris Skinner, the global FinTech pundit, heralds the beginning of FinTech with the launch of Zopa, a UK peer to peer lender started in 2005. It was the first time he had heard the word FinTech. US market place lenders Prosper, launched in 2005, and Lending Club, launched in 2006, were out of the gates before any evident signs of the impending crisis. Reuters launched in 1851 and claims to be one of the oldest FinTechs in the world pre-dating the Panic of 1873, the Great Crash of 29 and the recent crisis. It appears FinTech was not born out of the Financial Crisis. The bank bashing and demand for fairer and better products following the crisis was universal. This along with the availability of cheap money and the abundance of talent made available through the loss of banking jobs all came together to drive a decade of new FinTech 1.0 startups with grand visions of transforming financial services.

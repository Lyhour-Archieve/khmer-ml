Cards encoded with this system would have a thin stripe of nanoparticles added to the back in place of the standard magnetic strip. When a card is issued, a laser would project a few photons of light at the nanoparticles Because of the quantum nature of photons, each one can essentially be in more than one place and create a complex and unique pattern in the strip Reading one of these cards would require special hardware similar to the laser used to create the pattern in the first place. Terminals would be able to fire a bundle of photons into the strip and reach the resulting unique response

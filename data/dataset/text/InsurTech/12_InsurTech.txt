Hong Kong insurtech startup Wesurance will next month launch the city's first insurance app featuring artificial intelligence and electronic know your customer (eKYC) capabilities. The mobile app for insurance services has been launched in partnership with Allied World Assurance and TransUnion. The app features an AI powered virtual assistant named Amy who can walk customers through the process of taking out a policy. It will be available 24/7 from any location, and will use a frequently asked questions database to answer over 80% of customer queries. Unsolved questions will be immediately irected to internal representatives, and Amy will send reminders and notifications throughout the customer journey. Wesurance also incorporates eKYC and facial recognition technology for faster and easier user verification powered by TransUnion's IDVision solution. Users can take a photo of their HKID card followed by a selfie to accurately verify a user's identity. Claims can likewise be proceeded through Amy and by taking photos of supporting documents, and Wesurance promises a turnaround time of a few days. "At Wesurance, we deliver insuryech services that allow insurance providers to offer the same simplicity and customer centricity that Hong Kong residents expect in other areas of their lives," Wesurance CEO Eddie Chang (pictured) said. "Travel insurance policies are our first range of product. We plan to launch other insurance products on this platform at a later stage. We are confident that this mobile platform will transform the way consumers use insurance in Hong Kong." Wesurance will be available from the iTunes App Store or Google Play in early December.

Insurance industry startup Sure has launched an app-based rental car insurance product for U.S. customers. The move comes just a few months after the company released its smartphone-insurance product in June, enabling consumers to protect new or used mobile devices. Sure’s new offering can be applied to all rental companies and costs less than $10 a day, according to company CEO Wayne Slavin. The three coverage options offered by Sure -- basic, platinum and platinum family-- can also be purchased in under a minute. The company intends to provide more thorough, cheaper automobile insurance than what is traditionally offered by rental companies, it says. Sure’s policies, underwritten by Chubb, cover anything from additional drivers and property theft to fender benders, flat tires and more serious physical damage. "Customers want to have a pleasant experience and not have to experience high-pressure sale tactics at the rental car counter,” says Slavin. “Our goal is to make buying rental car insurance as quick, easy and comprehensive as possible, while delivering better and more complete coverage."
